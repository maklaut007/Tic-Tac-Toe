# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe written in JavaScript.

This project is written in pure JavaScript and uses classes to implement OOP programming concepts.

## Technologies Used:

- HLML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Features

- The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on an empty cell.

- The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row or when the board is full and no player has won.

- In case of one of the player winning, the corresponding player score will increase by 1

- The player could restart the game at any stage and it wouldn't count to any player score.
